# Hey, I'm Vidal Vasconcelos

I’ve been coding for over 10 years at companies of all sizes, driven by a love for 
software development. I’ve had the chance to work with Backend, Frontend, and 
Infrastructure technologies, always aiming to build reliable software and foster 
strong, healthy development teams.
