### Hey, I'm Vidal Vasconcelos

I'm passionate about software development, always looking for how we can produce more reliable software and build healthy teams, on this journey I had the opportunity to work with Backend, Frontend and Infrastructure technologies, and contribute to communities like [PHP com 
Rapadura](https://github.com/PHPcomRapadura), and [Sobral Developer Group](https://github.com/sobral-developers-group), encouraging developer culture through Coding dojo, Meetups and Tech Talks.
