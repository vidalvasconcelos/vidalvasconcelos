### Hey, I'm Vidal Vasconcelos

I started programming with php in 2012, since then I had the opportunity to work with backend, frontend and infrastructure technologies and also for different 
company sizes.

In this journey I got to know great developers with whom I learned a lot and I was also able to contribute with some development communities such as [PHP com 
Rapadura](https://github.com/PHPcomRapadura), [Sobral Developer Group](https://github.com/sobral-developers-group), and [Laravel Brasil](https://github.com/laravelbrasil), encouraging the culture of the developer through Coding dojo, Meetups and Tech Talks.

Today, I work at continuous enhancement of the observability and maintainability in PHP legacy applications, increasing resilience and creating tools using 
GO as a main language.
