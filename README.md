# Hey, I'm Vidal Vasconcelos

More than 10 years of writing code in companies of different sizes have always been guided by my deep passion for software development and on this journey I had the opportunity to work with Backend, Frontend and Infrastructure technologies, prioritizing the construction of more reliable software and the construction of healthy development teams.
